shareApp
========

Proof of concept for basic money sharing app in JS/jQuery. No data persistence in this version.

This is just a basic UI concept for a responsive, JS/bootstrap based money sharing app. Developed to track finances between myself and my girlfriend. The goal was for a simple interface that works well on desktop + mobile (any platform). 

I decided raw JS/jQuery was a silly way to do this properly, so I scrapped it and am rebuilding/refactoring it into an AngularJS app and looking to use FireBase for storage.
