Proof of concept for basic money sharing app in JS/jQuery. No file persistence in this version.

This is just a basic UI concept for a responsive, JS/bootstrap based money sharing app. Developed to track finances between myself and my girlfriend.

I decided raw JS/jQuery was a silly way to do this properly, so I'm refactoring it into an AngularJS app and looking to use FireBase for storage.
